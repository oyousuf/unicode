The Masaba script is used to write the Bambara language of West Africa. It is a syllabary with 125 letters and 7 diacritics. You can find a font file (MasabaFont.otf) and keyboard file (masaba.kmx) here to use. First download Keyman keyboard online (https://keyman.com/windows/download), and then install this Masaba keyboard file to use it on your computer. After you download the Masaba font file, simply click on it in your file explorer and click "install", you will then be able to see it on the font dropdown menu in Microsoft Word. The Masaba script is (as of now) unencoded in Unicode, so the font file uses Private Use Area (PUA) codepoints. This means you can only use the keyboard/font on your computer on text editing software like Microsoft Office products (e.g., Microsoft Word).
