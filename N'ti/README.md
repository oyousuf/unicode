The N'ti script is used to write the Soninke language of West Africa. It is an alphabet with 27 letters and 8 diacritics. You can find a font file (N'tiFont.otf) and keyboard file (soninke_n_ti.kmx) here to use. First download Keyman keyboard online (https://keyman.com/windows/download), and then install this N'ti keyboard file to use it on your computer. After you download the N'ti font file, simply click on it in your file explorer and click "install", you will then be able to see it on the font dropdown menu in Microsoft Word. The N'ti script is (as of now) unencoded in Unicode, so the font file uses Private Use Area (PUA) codepoints. This means you can only use the keyboard/font on your computer on text editing software like Microsoft Office products (e.g., Microsoft Word).
