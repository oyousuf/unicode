The N'ti script is used to write the Soninke language of West Africa. It is an alphabet with 27 letters and 8 diacritics. You can find a font and keyboard file here to use. Download Keyman keyboard online, and then install this N'ti keyboard file to use it on your computer. The N'ti script is (as of now) unencoded in Unicode, so the font file uses Private Use Area (PUA) codepoints. This means you can only use the keyboard/font on your computer on text editing software like Microsoft Office products (e.g., Microsoft Word).
